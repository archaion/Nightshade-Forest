<h1>
<a name="223r2">
ZAngbandTk 2.2.3r2 (April 16, 1999)
</a>
</h1>
<ul>
<li>Clicking the Message Window will toggle the inventory/spell/mindcraft/power
display. This is in addition to the previous behaviour of displaying the
previous message or bypassing the -more- prompt.</li>
<li>Added menu help strings to the most of the windows.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where any trailing 'r' was stripped from the trigger of a
macro when displayed in the "Trigger" label. This was already fixed for
triggers displayed in the list of macros.</li>
<li>Fixed the transparency color in "save.gif".</li>
<li>Fixed problem with get_stats() in tcl-birth.c. It must have been using
the code from Angband, not ZAngband!</li>
<li>The auto-roller screen in the Birth Window now displays the total
roll needed to create a character with the stats entered by the user. This
figure can be used to decide whether the auto-roller can possibly roll the
given combination of stats.</li>
<li>Added the Find command to the Help Window (which was removed when the
TkHTML widget was added). I had to add "search" and "see" commands to TkHTML
in order for this to work.</li>
<li>Made various cosmetic changes to make building under MS VC++ smoother.</li>
<li>Merged together all the tk, tk/src and tk/library sources for all the
*AngbandTk games.</li>
<li>Added a groovy About Window with a scrolling list of credits.</li>
<li>The icon .icd and .msk files are now compressed using zlib.dll.</li>
<li>Added "ascii isascii" command to see if an icon type has a font.</li>
<li>Various other changes I forgot to write down.</li>
</ul>

<li>The previous roll in character creation is now available, just like
the original game.</li>
<li>The Birth Options Window allows the user to set all the options which
can only be changed at character creation. The options are saved to the
tk/config/birth file.</li>

row height.</li>
<li>Corrected some graphics glitches, and added Adam Bolt's better feature
graphics (grass, dirt, water, lava).</li>
