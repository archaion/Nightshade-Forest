Q:126:T:I trust you found some usefull items!,... good, I have some news
Q:126:T:from my historian, he has been going over documents pertaining to
Q:126:T:the old "Dark Market" activities in the old city. He has found an
Q:126:T:interesting account of a powerful artifact that was comissioned by
Q:126:T:the old king. It seems that although the artifact was completed,
Q:126:T:he never sent a regent to pick it up. The historian believes it
Q:126:T:could very well be burried within the ruins of the old "Dark
Q:126:T:Market". Finding it will be no easy task, the ruins in that area
Q:126:T:are overridden with rubble. You'll need a good pick and shovel!
