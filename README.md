ABOUT
<br>

Based on the AngbandTK graphical roguelike, this mod introduces a completely revamped high-definition isometric tileset. It also changes the names of various monsters and races to be more appropriate for the setting, makes all classes playable for every race, and reconfigures a few of the sound effects. The game is optimized for viewing at 800 x 600 and most options are preset for convenience, but these settings can be changed in the Options menu or by adjusting them manually. For gameplay instructions, see the Help menu. 
<br>

Credit goes to Tim Baker for AngbandTK, David E. Gervais for the tileset, and the Angband team for inspiring this project.
