ABOUT

This mod introduces a custom HD isometric tileset, which is best viewed at lower resolutions (eg. 800 x 600). It also changes the names of various monsters and races to be more appropriate for the setting, makes all classes playable for every race, and reconfigures a few of the sound effects. See below for a full list of changes.


CHANGES 

- All environment graphics completely overhauled
- New sprites for six monsters using the wrong tileset
- Higher quality player sprites with better colors
- Lore-accurate races and character backgrounds
- Class restrictions removed for all player races
- Improved designs for shields, scrolls and staffs
- Realistic new sprites for most canines and felines
- A few minor changes to various other monsters
- More appropriate sound effects for townspeople
- Ambient sound effects for dungeon areas
