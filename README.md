ABOUT
<br>

Based on AngbandTk v2.9.2r3, this mod introduces a completely revamped high-definition isometric tileset. It also changes the names of various monsters and races to be more appropriate for the setting, makes all classes playable for every race, and reconfigures a few of the sound effects. The game is optimized for viewing at 800 x 600 and most options are preset for convenience, but these settings can be changed in the Options menu or by adjusting them manually. For gameplay instructions, see the Help menu.

Credit goes to Tim Baker for AngbandTK, David E. Gervais for the tileset, and the Angband team for inspiring this project.
